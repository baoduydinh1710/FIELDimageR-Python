# FIELDimageR-Python
1. fieldAUC: Calculate the area under the curve given by vectors of xy-coordinates.
2. fieldArea: It calculates the percentage of object area in the entire mosaic or per plot using the fieldShape file.
3. fieldCount: The mask from function \code{\link{fieldMask}} is used to identify the number of objects per plot..
4. fieldCrop: It calculates the percentage of object area in the entire mosaic or per plot using the fieldShape file.
5. fieldDraw: Extracting information (x, y, value) for all cells in a line or polygon. Also, this function can be used to evaluate distances between objects or objects length.
6. fieldIndex: Different vegetation indices can be calculated using at least 3 bands.
7. fieldInfo: extract information from the original image using fieldShape file as reference.
8. fieldMap:  Field map ID identification to align with plots shapefile built with fieldShape(). The plots are numbered from left to right and top to bottom.
9. fieldMask: Different vegetation indices can be used to remove images background.
10. fiedlObject: Calculating the object dimensions
11. fieldPlot: Graphic visualization of trait values for each plot using the fieldShape file and original image.
12. fieldPolygon: The user should select points to make polygons in the image
13. fieldRotate: The image should be rotated to use the function
14. fieldShape: The user should select the four experimental field corners and the shape file with plots will be automatcly built using a grid with the number of ranges and rows.
